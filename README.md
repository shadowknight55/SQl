The schema contains the following tables:
1. *Customers*: Stores customer information.
2. *Products*: Stores product details and inventory.
3. *Orders*: Tracks customer orders.

   - Run the following command to clone the project repository to your local machine:
bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <repository_name>
     
---
## *3. Set Up the Application*
1. *Install Dependencies*:
   - In the project directory, run:
bash
     npm install
     
2. *Configure the .env File*:
   - Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following variables:
plaintext
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_NAME=ecommerce_store
        DB_USER=root
        DB_PASSWORD=ManECommerceNeedOSHA
        PORT=3000
     
---
## *4. Run the Application*

2. *Test the App*:
   - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.
---
## *5. Verify Everything Works*
1. *Verify SQL Server Database*:
