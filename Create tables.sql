-- #### Reflection Questions 1
-- After completing the joins, reflect on the following:
-- - How does joining tables help you get a fuller picture of customer orders and product information?
-- By joining the customers table with the orders table, we can retrieve not just the order data but also customer details like name, email, and address
-- - Which joins were most challenging to understand? Why?
-- LEFT JOIN: because it includes all records from the left table (e.g., orders), even if there is no matching record in the right table
-- - How could joining tables and using aggregations be useful for reporting in an e-commerce application?
-- By joining orders with order_details and using SUM(), you can calculate total sales for each day

-- #### Reflection 2
-- - How do the tables work together to create a full picture of customers and orders?
-- Each order works together to make everything work  
-- - Why are foreign keys essential in linking different tables in a relational database?
-- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity between tables
-- - What challenges did you face in designing this schema?
-- I faced the biggest chagllend forgetting the small things 

#### Reflection Questions 3
-- Once youâ€™ve completed the queries, consider the following:
-- How do aggregate functions like `SUM()` and `AVG()` help you gain insights into the data?
-- Aggregate functions like SUM() and AVG() are invaluable in summarizing large datasets
-- What insights could you gather from combining multiple functions (e.g., `SUM()` and `DATE()`)?
-- Combining multiple functions like SUM() and DATE() can provide more granular insights that are time-sensitive and actionable
-- Why might limiting results (e.g., to the top 5) be useful in reporting for an e-commerce store?
-- For instance, if you are analyzing sales, limiting the query to the top 5 products
