-- 11. Queries for analysis

-- Calculate Average Order Value
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_order_value FROM orders;

-- Count Orders by Status
SELECT order_status AS status, COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM orders GROUP BY order_status;

-- Find Highest Priced Product
SELECT product_id, name, price FROM products WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products);

-- Calculate Total Quantity Sold per Product
SELECT p.product_id, p.name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM order_details od
JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id;

-- List Customers with Total Amount Spent
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, SUM(od.price_per_product * od.quantity) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;

-- Retrieve Customer Order Details (Delivered orders only)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_status = 'Delivered';

-- Complex Join with Aggregation (Customer Orders and Amount Spent)
SELECT 
    c.customer_id, 
    c.first_name, 
    c.last_name, 
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders, 
    SUM(od.price_per_product * od.quantity) AS total_amount_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount_spent DESC;

-- #### Reflection Questions 1
-- After completing the joins, reflect on the following:
-- - How does joining tables help you get a fuller picture of customer orders and product information?
-- By joining the customers table with the orders table, we can retrieve not just the order data but also customer details like name, email, and address
-- - Which joins were most challenging to understand? Why?
-- LEFT JOIN: because it includes all records from the left table (e.g., orders), even if there is no matching record in the right table
-- - How could joining tables and using aggregations be useful for reporting in an e-commerce application?
-- By joining orders with order_details and using SUM(), you can calculate total sales for each day

-- #### Reflection 2
-- - How do the tables work together to create a full picture of customers and orders?
-- Each order works together to make everything work  
-- - Why are foreign keys essential in linking different tables in a relational database?
-- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity between tables
-- - What challenges did you face in designing this schema?
-- I faced the biggest chagllend forgetting the small things 

-- #### Reflection Questions 3
-- Once youâ€™ve completed the queries, consider the following:
-- How do aggregate functions like `SUM()` and `AVG()` help you gain insights into the data?
-- Aggregate functions like SUM() and AVG() are invaluable in summarizing large datasets
-- What insights could you gather from combining multiple functions (e.g., `SUM()` and `DATE()`)?
-- Combining multiple functions like SUM() and DATE() can provide more granular insights that are time-sensitive and actionable
-- Why might limiting results (e.g., to the top 5) be useful in reporting for an e-commerce store?
-- For instance, if you are analyzing sales, limiting the query to the top 5 products
